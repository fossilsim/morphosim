\title{Plots morphological matrix}
\usage{
plotMorphoGrid(
  data = NULL,
  timetree = FALSE,
  num.trait = "all",
  col = c("#fdfdfd", "lightgray", "lightblue", "pink", "yellow", "green", "orange")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A morpho object}

\item{num.trait}{default is set to "all" which plots all traits in black font. If you
want to focus on a specific trait set it here, e.g. num.trait = 1 and this trait will
be highlighted}

\item{col}{A vector of colors that should be the same length or longer than the number of different character states (k). if not specified, the traits from 0 to 6 can be differentiated}
}
\description{
This function plots the full morphological matrix assocaited with the character data
at the tips of a tree. Requires a morpho object as input.
}
\examples{
 # simualte a tree
phy <- ape::rtree(10)

# simulate character data for the tree
simulated_morpho <- sim.morpho(phy, k = 2, trait.num = 10)

# plot the character matrix
plotMorphoGrid(data = simulated_morpho, num.trait = 1)

}
