\usage{
sim.missing.data(
  data = NULL,
  seq = NULL,
  method = NULL,
  probability = NULL,
  traits = NULL,
  taxa = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A `morpho` object with sequence data.}

\item{seq}{Character. Which sequence data to use: `"tips"`, `"nodes"`, or `"SA"`.}

\item{method}{Character. Method for removing data. Options:
- `"random"`: removes characters randomly across the matrix.
- `"partition"`: removes characters by partition (probabilities per partition).
- `"rate"`: removes characters by rate category (probabilities per rate category).
- `"trait"`: removes characters from specific traits.
- `"taxa"`: removes characters from specific taxa.}

\item{probability}{Numeric. Probability of missing data (single value or vector depending on method).}

\item{traits}{When `method = "trait"`, indices of traits to remove.}

\item{taxa}{When `method = "taxa"`, indices of taxa to remove.}
}
\value{
An object of class morpho.
}
\description{
This function removes characters from a morphological matrix simulated using morphosim
