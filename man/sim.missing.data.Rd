\title{Remove morphological character data}
\usage{
sim.missing.data(
  data = NULL,
  seq = NULL,
  method = NULL,
  probability = NULL,
  traits = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A morpho object with sequence data}

\item{seq}{Specify which sequence you want to use ("tips", "nodes", "SA")}

\item{method}{Under what criteria data should be removed. Methods include "random" which randomly removes
characters across the entire matrix, "partition" which allows different partitions (that were used to simulate the data)
to loose varying amounts of characters, "rates" which removes characters based on the rate the were simulated under,
and "trait" where the user can specify particular traits to remove data.}

\item{probability}{The probability of missing data to simulate.}

\item{traits}{When method = trait, used to specify which trait you want to remove data from}
}
\value{
An object of class morpho.
}
\description{
This function removes characters from a morphological matrix simulated using morphosim
}
